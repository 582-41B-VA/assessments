# Checkpoint 1: Models

> Due: October 2

Checkpoint 1 focuses on defining models and setting up views. Here are
the requirements:

- Products have a name, description, image, price, quantity, and
  creation date. You may add additional fields if necessary.
- Products have an `is_available` property that is true when their
  quantity is greater than 0.
- Products belong to a category. Categories have a name and a
  description.
- Products and categories can be added and modified from the built-in
  admin panel.
- On the home page, users can see a list of all products currently
  available. Products are sorted by their creation date in descending
  order.
- The home page includes a list of categories. Clicking on a category
  brings users to a page where products from that category are listed.
  On the category page, the name and the description of the category is
  shown.
- Clicking on a product brings users to a details page where information
  about that product is shown (name, description, image, etc.). At the
  bottom the page, users can see more products from the same category.
- The website has a navigation bar that includes the name of the store
  and a link to the home page.
