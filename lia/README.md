# Assessment: LIA

For this course's Learning Integration Assessment (LIA), you will use
Django to build an online shop. The project will be carried out in teams
of two. It is divided into six "checkpoints", each graded separately.
You will find the requirements for each checkpoint in the accompanying
files.

## Assessment criteria

- Program design
  - requirements are met
  - program flow is decomposed into manageable, logical pieces
  - data structures are appropriate
  - common code is unified, not duplicated
  - appropriate algorithms are used, and coded cleanly
  - interfaces are used correctly
  - code is lint-free (see `uv run ruff check`)
  - code is well-tested
  - project is well-structured
  - markup is semantic
  - no global variables

- Readability
  - constants are used instead of hard-coded values
  - complex or meaningful expressions are named
  - naming is consistent and descriptive
  - inline comments are used to explain reasoning
  - code is formatted (see `uv run ruff format`)

- Version control
  - commits contain related changes
  - messages are consistent and informative
  - changes are merged using pull requests

- Teamwork
  - workload is divided evenly (styling will not be assessed and
    therefore doesn't count toward your workload)
  - comments on pull requests are useful
  - peer assessment
