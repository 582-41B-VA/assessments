# Checkpoint 0: Setup

> Due: September 25

Checkpoint 0 focuses on setting up the GitHub repository you will use to
work on the project. To do so, please complete the following tasks:

1. Pair up with another student.
2. Decide on the product your store will sell (e.g., books, t-shirts,
   candles, posters, etc.).
3. Pick a name for your store.
4. Choose who will be responsible for creating the repository. That
   student must click [here][Classroom] and follow the instructions.
5. Set the name of the repository to your store's name. (Settings →
   General → Repository name)
6. Give your teammate access to the repository. (Settings →
   Collaborators and teams → Manage access)
7. Protect your main branch. A pull request should be required before
   merging, and 1 approval (your teammate's) should be necessary before
   a pull request can be merged. (Settings → Branches → Add classic
   branch protection rule → Require a pull request before merging)
8. Create a README file with a brief description of the project and
   setup instructions for new team members (how to install, how to make
   changes, etc.).
